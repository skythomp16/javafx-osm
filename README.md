# OSM Software
This software is written in JavaFX and is designed to replace the aging POM Software that has issues running on modern Windows.

## Work In Progress
This is a project that is very new and is a work in progress.  Currently only the linear programming module is created and working.

## Modules
Right now, this application focuses on three main functions:
- Linear Programming
- Time Series Forecasting
- Casual Regression Forecasting

## Features
This app supports features such as:
- Saving problems
- Loading problems
- Generating reports from problems
- Up to 20 variables and constraints (Linear Programming)

## Get Involved
This is an early project that requires a lot of work to achieve the feature parity desired.  If you want to get involved, fork this repository, make code changes, and submit a pull request back to this repository.  

We also welcome testers to test functionality and open bug tickets!

## Building
To build this project, simply run:
```
mvn clean javafx:run
